# Solar-Flare-Analysis
Machine learning analysis of solar flare effects on GPS systems using spectral data from the March 2015 solar storm

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Analyze whether intense solar flare activity corresponds to anomalies in GPS-relevant data.
- **Dataset:** Spectral measurements sourced from NASAâ€™s Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) during the March 2015 solar storm.
- **Method:** Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to detect anomalies in the time-series spectral data.
- **Results:** Successfully detected outlier points that align with the timing of major solar events, suggesting potential GPS impact.

## Technologies and Tools

- Python 3.10+
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for anomaly detection
